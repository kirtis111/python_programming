======== 
1- scan the QR code 
2- In the demo session what are topics i covered 
3- what are main trending topic i will covered 
===
HOW MANY OF THEM HAS NON TECHNICAL 
NON-TECH EXPERIENCE - 	BPO, TEACHNING, PROFESSOR, 
TECH EXPERIECE - 	JAVA 12, MANGER - 20YR, .NET 4 , JAVA 5, 
FRESHER OR B.TECH
everyone is elligile to learn this course 
	non technical student 
	techn experience
	non tech experience
	fresher 
	carrera gap happily learn this course 
			generati ai -- 2024 ( 
			agentic -- 2025 
			prompt engineer - 2024
=== 
chatgpt -- openai ( microsoft ) purchase this  (chtgpt -- llm model )
5 days -- chatgpt 1million customer 
===
gen ai model are 2 types
	text based model -->
		user enter text model generate text 
	multi model 
		user enter text model generate image, video 

90% practicle & 10% theory 

I will explian only in english but you can ask me in hindi, telugu, odia, tamil , bengali 
	
2016 - 2020 -- machine learning lot of opening
2021- 2022 -- ml, dl, nn
2023-2024 -- generative ai & prompt engineer 
2025 - gen ai, agentic ai 
--
--
AI is keep increaseting | we need to upskill our mindset 

AI replace 50% developer | 10 job ( 5 jobs)

AI IS NOT KILL THE JOB  THE ONE WHO LEARNS AI HE KILL THE JOB 
every jobs are AUTOMIZATION 

	10 yr back -- 24/7 call center 	now everyhthing replace by chatbot(zomatobot) 

Machine learngin from the historical data you feed data to machine before 
Netflix =-- if you watch action move | recommandation algorithm 
		
CAGR -- CURRENT ANNUAL GROWTH RATE 

we will build generative ai project using help of huggingface.com
--		
Laptop configuration -->

3 DAYS TO COMPLETE THE DEMO

===== ALL THE DEMO ARE COMPLETED =====

online team ( student raise their hand) expeceted answer)
they are angrey -- 6 months
if my class will stop 




-- the student who technical expert again just be patienc 
-- first day i cant start oops fresher not understand 
-- the student who already know oops just calm down 

the student experience, ceo, cto, leader, fresher, non tech
just calm down cuz i will uumute then i will answer your of your query

8:30 am this is best time learn AI concept 
code, 

-- Complete python just calm downl 
-- I have some things tocomplete 
-- Today i will share one link to install the software ( can you go & install the software)


1- google
2- google colab
3- new notebook 

Task-1 : work with number & arithmatic operator 

+, - , *, /, 

non technincal -- number
python programmin -- number we called as integer 
short form of integer is INT 

non technical -- text 
pyhton programe -- text we called string

python string always ends with  ' ', " " ,  ''' ''' 

pthon error -- bug 
fix the error - debugging or debug 

python error type -->
	synatax error -- if user enter any wrong code then system give you syntax erro 
	user miss , :, 

3 + 4 
3 & 4 -- operand 
+ - operator 

python error  3 types
	compile time error 
	run time error
	logical erro 
	
god create python only for non technical team .

6- if any one has any issue on installeat please reach out my mentor 
7- once select anaconda folder 
		anaconda navigator 
		command prompt 
		jupyter notebook
		spyder 
8- search - cmd - python -- test your code 
		anaconda prompt -- test the code 

=== 1st codeing 

number -- integer (int)
text - string '' "" ''' ''' 

after the class i will share installation video ( you can watch install it)
====
Python -->
===
- why to learn python 
- work with numbers
- work with string ( I will explain indepth of the string)
- pyton is object oriented programing 
		object 

syntax to define python variable 
	 (variable name = value )
	 
v = 5 
    v is variable , 5 is value ( number )
	
v1 = 'nit'
	v1 is variable , 'nit' (string) 

always remember you need to call the assigned variable it self 


1- please install software ( share the link please wathc it)
2- we will start code togetaher 

Name error
syntax error

.doc | .xlcx | .pdf 

.py 
jupyter notebook all the extension ares .ipynb 
	interactive python note book
	
8gb ram ( 16gb ram)
512gb ssd
intel core processor 
w 10 11
1tb hard 
>i5 

^^^^^^ 26th

i will take the back up class 5 days 
i will share last 4 days recording session 
we just compelte  4 days only
any leanrer who complete ml, pyhton, sql, nlp 

java - 8 line 
c & c# - more line 
python - les snumer of code 

father - who invented python Guido van Rosam
complete monty python's flying circus'' - broadcasted in BBC channel
python 

java 1995 python 1989 -- no one used python at that 
python is more popular when ( ml, data, ) python become popular now 

python has more librar compare to java 

python doesnot works at mobie based application 

write one code in python 
same code can run in winds, linux, mac 

library 
	ml frame - sklearn
	dl frame - tensorflow, keras
	llm frame - langchain, langgrpah
	computer vison -- opencv, yolo, mediapipe
	nlp frame --  nltk, spacy
	data analy - numpy, pandas, plt, sns 
	agentic ai -- phi data, crew ai 
	---
python version 

bigdata and data sciecen -- anaconda python 
i told to install anaconda software -- you already done that 

python version 
	python 1.
	python 2.0
	python 3.0 

software -->
	anaconda -- 
	jupyter
	spyder - ml 
	 vs code
	 colab
	 pychar
	
python introducion -- we completed 

python ide ( integrated development environment)
	using ide one can write the code, fix the erro, excute the programe 
	
using IDE - one can write code, run the code, debug the code
	ide -->
		jupyter
		vs code
		pycharm 

python interpreter 
python compiler 

cpu vs gpu 
local system = personal system -- you install software -- jupyter notebook(cpu) 
google == google machine == using jupyter noteb = google ( gpu)  -- cloud 

execute the code line by line - interpreter 
exeute entire code at once - compiler 

does python is interpreter or compiler == both 

VARIABLE :
	variable name = value
	
a = 5 | a - variable  | 5 - value 
---
Rules to define python variable -->
----
1- variables are case sensitive 
2- variable never start with digit but ends with digit 
3- special symbols are not allowed to define variable only _ is allowed 
4- keyword are never b
	
keyword or reserve words

python function are always ends with ():

variable vs function 

c proga - keywords
java - keyword
python - keyword

if you completed all the keywords ( python complete) 

['False',
 'None',
 'True',
 'and',
 'as',
 'assert',
 'async',
 'await',

T:1 - Python variable class explanation, documentation 

^^^^^^^ 27th 

5th day our new batch 
I  will share 4 days recording & at last i will overview 
i will unmute you and we will discuss if you have any question 

My team will share recoding, course syllabus 

function() 

variable = value 

value --> 	number, text, decimal, 

value == data types 

python data types 

VARIABLE = VALUES ( DATATYPES)

yesterday we arecompleted variables 
today we will discuss value or data type 

oops -->
	object oriented progrmming language 

class 
	inbuild class --> 
	user define class 
method
encapsulation 
polymorphsim
inheritence
abstraction

int - value without decimal 
float - value with decimal
bool - either true or false
complex - a + bj (only j letter is allowed 
		a - real part
		b- imaginary part
		j- squre root of -1 
any other programin language you dont have this datatypes

real time we will use this datatype in math application (

only thoery -- you never ever get the job 
organiztion - 9 hr you have to work 
college -- only theory 

string quotes with ' ' || " " | '''   '''

''' ''' == multline string 

multiline in nlp 

python slicing concept --> :
python index --> 2 part 
	forward index --> left to right --> begines with 0
	backward index --> right to left --> -1

TYPE CASTING 
--
from all other datatype to int 

# we can type cast from all other data type to integer except complex & text string 


why we leanring his 
work in project ( whole nmer( decimal number)
type casting 


if you complete work -- store those work in your computer
computer -- all work witll loss 
you have to store reguarl in github  & show to work to world
