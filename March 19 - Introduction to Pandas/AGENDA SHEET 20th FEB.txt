====
Python -->
===
- why to learn python 
- work with numbers
- work with string ( I will explain indepth of the string)
- pyton is object oriented programing 
		object 

syntax to define python variable 
	 (variable name = value )
	 
v = 5 
    v is variable , 5 is value ( number )
	
v1 = 'nit'
	v1 is variable , 'nit' (string) 

always remember you need to call the assigned variable it self 


1- please install software ( share the link please wathc it)
2- we will start code togetaher 

Name error
syntax error

.doc | .xlcx | .pdf

^^^^^^ 26th

i will take the back up class 5 days 
i will share last 4 days recording session 
we just compelte  4 days only
any leanrer who complete ml, pyhton, sql, nlp 

java - 8 line 
c & c# - more line 
python - les snumer of code 

father - who invented python Guido van Rosam
complete monty python's flying circus'' - broadcasted in BBC channel
python 

java 1995 python 1989 -- no one used python at that 
python is more popular when ( ml, data, ) python become popular now 

python has more librar compare to java 

python doesnot works at mobie based application 

write one code in python 
same code can run in winds, linux, mac 

library 
	ml frame - sklearn
	dl frame - tensorflow, keras
	llm frame - langchain, langgrpah
	computer vison -- opencv, yolo, mediapipe
	nlp frame --  nltk, spacy
	data analy - numpy, pandas, plt, sns 
	agentic ai -- phi data, crew ai 
	---
python version 

bigdata and data sciecen -- anaconda python 
i told to install anaconda software -- you already done that 

python version 
	python 1.
	python 2.0
	python 3.0 

software -->
	anaconda -- 
	jupyter
	spyder - ml 
	 vs code
	 colab
	 pychar
	
python introducion -- we completed 

python ide ( integrated development environment)
	using ide one can write the code, fix the erro, excute the programe 
	
using IDE - one can write code, run the code, debug the code
	ide -->
		jupyter
		vs code
		pycharm 

python interpreter 
python compiler 

cpu vs gpu 
local system = personal system -- you install software -- jupyter notebook(cpu) 
google == google machine == using jupyter noteb = google ( gpu)  -- cloud 

execute the code line by line - interpreter 
exeute entire code at once - compiler 

does python is interpreter or compiler == both 

VARIABLE :
	variable name = value
	
a = 5 | a - variable  | 5 - value 
---
Rules to define python variable -->
----
1- variables are case sensitive 
2- variable never start with digit but ends with digit 
3- special symbols are not allowed to define variable only _ is allowed 
4- keyword are never b
	
keyword or reserve words

python function are always ends with ():

variable vs function 

c proga - keywords
java - keyword
python - keyword

if you completed all the keywords ( python complete) 

['False',
 'None',
 'True',
 'and',
 'as',
 'assert',

list slicing --> :

: - entire elment
2:10 --> Print the element from 2nd index to n-1 (10-1) 9th index 
				always right index should be n-1 formula is applicabel 
:10 -->  print the element from starting to n-1 
3: --> print the element from 3rd indext to last index 
1:100:10 
	-> print start indext (1st ) & last index (100) & step index (10)
every 10th step count
